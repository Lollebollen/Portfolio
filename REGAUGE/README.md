## Player
 *add diagram of structure here* <br/>
 Implementing couch co-op with unitys input system requierd some structure for REGAUGE since the player needed to swap between multiple differnt kinds of charcters. The implementation I went with is having a controler that can attach charcters to itself and most of the time handle the logic for switching charater.

 ## Tiniest Map
 The game had a bit of a problem during a playtest which was that it was realy boring to keep playing for a while. This was know ofcourse however the focus until then was to make a great base. So when we felt that we could spend some time we started adding to the breadth of the game including new maps.

The design behind this behmoth of a map was to be a palet cleansers between the more intrecet and longer lasting maps that already exsited. I wanted it to be a bunch of repeted 1v1s since all the other maps consisted of mostly large open areas were one can not completly have a have an uninterupted fight.
